;;; setup-company.el ---  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;; Code:

;; Completion will start automatically after you type a few letters.
;; Use M-n and M-p to select, <return> to complete or <tab> to complete the common part.
;; Search through the completions with C-s, C-r and C-o.
;; Press M-(digit) to quickly complete with one of the first 10 candidates.
;; Type M-x company-complete to initiate completion manually. Bind this command to a key combination of your choice.
;; When the completion candidates are shown,
;;  press <f1> to display the documentation for the selected candidate, or
;;         C-w to see its source. Not all back-ends support this.
